            <div class="essay-preview">
                The most common type of startup advice is probably the most valuable: the sort that's based on experience. But there's another type of advice that's more valuable still: the sort that's based on experience, but that you wouldn't have been able to figure out yourself. This is the kind of advice that's most worth paying attention to, because it's the kind that's most likely to be true.

                Reddit is one of the most interesting social news sites on the web. It's also one of the most misunderstood. People often think of it as a news aggregator, but it's really more like a community. The difference is important, because it explains why Reddit is so successful, and why it's so hard to copy.

                If you wanted to get rich, how would you do it? I think your best bet would be to start or join a startup. That's been a reliable way to get rich for hundreds of years. The word "startup" dates from the 1960s, but what happens in one is very similar to the venture-backed trading voyages of the Middle Ages.

                One of the most important things to understand about the world is that some things are superlinear. That is, they grow faster than linearly. This is a very important concept, because it explains a lot of things that would otherwise seem mysterious.
